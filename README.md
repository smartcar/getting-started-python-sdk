This is the starter kit for Python SDK.

This kit contains a simple web application that displays car information using Smartcar's Python SDK.

## Instructions
Before we get started, create an application on Smartcar's Developer Dashboard to get your API keys.

**Note:** On the dashboard, you will want to set your `redirect_uri` as `http://localhost:8000/exchange`.

Then, we can set these as environment variables -
```bash
$ export CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
$ export CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
$ export REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/exchange
```

Make sure you have cloned this repo -
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/smartcar/getting-started-python-sdk.git
$ cd getting-started-python-sdk/app
```

To install the required dependencies and run this Python app -
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```

Once your server is up and running, you can authenticate your vehicle. In our current set up, we are using Smartcar's [test mode](https://smartcar.com/docs/guides/testing/), so you can log in with any username and password. To authenticate, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/login`. Once you have authenticated, go to `http://localhost:8000/vehicle` to see your vehicle information.

**Note:** We recommend you use a virtual environment. If you are using Python 3, refer to [this guide](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). If you are using Python 2, refer to the [docs](https://virtualenv.pypa.io).

## Next Steps
